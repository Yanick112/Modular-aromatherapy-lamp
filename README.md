A record of learning and practicing with an open-source modular aromatherapy lamp.

This is an **amateur-level** learning record, and it has been put on hold for various reasons.It is for reference only. Friends who have spare time and are interested can also pass it on.

The circuit schematic design was done using 嘉立创 EDC, and only the initial schematic design has been completed. No proper PCB layout has been conducted yet. The hardware structure design is partially complete, but there is still much room for optimization and improvement.

All files are open-source in the folder and are for reference only.
