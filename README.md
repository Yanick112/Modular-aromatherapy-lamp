An open-source record of learning and practicing with a modular aromatherapy lamp.

This is an **amateur-level** learning record, and it has been put on hold for various reasons.It is for reference only. Friends who have spare time and are interested can also pass it on.

The circuit schematic design was done using 嘉立创 EDC, and only the initial schematic design has been completed. No proper PCB layout has been conducted yet. The hardware structure design is partially complete, but there is still much room for optimization and improvement.

All files are open-source in the folder and are for reference only.

### Design concept

- The central idea is: a freely controllable atmosphere creator
- Centered around replaceable aromatherapy and IoT ambient lighting
- The appearance style can be freely changed through convenient 3D printing
- It uses an ultrasonic atomization solution (more cost-effective)
- Designed with heat dissipation and capacity alarm to enhance usability
- The fan, water pump, storage bottle, and atomization chip use standard parts
- All structural components are designed according to 3D printing standards
